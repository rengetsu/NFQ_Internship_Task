## Task

Screens with serial numbers can be seen in customer service departments (bank, outpatient
clinic, post office, etc.). The incoming customer prints out the number and the display shows the
waiting line and the customers place in it. To avoid serial numbers printed on paper, a system is
needed that could allow the customer to book a visit time using a website. After booking the
time of the visit, the customer could see the waiting line and their respected place in it. The
queue is displayed on the service department screens. The customer can see how much time
he has left before the meeting according to the reservation code.
